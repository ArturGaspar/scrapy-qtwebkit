Qt WebKit for Scrapy
====================

This is a Scrapy middleware for rendering pages with Qt WebKit. It allows for
easy and integrated rendering of web pages with Javascript, and interaction in
spider callbacks. Network requests are made with Scrapy, passing through all
your existing downloader and spider middlewares.

See the `examples` directory for examples on how to use.
